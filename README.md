-  Easily manage your followers, catch your nonfollowers and unfollowers.





### How it works

After logging in with your information, necessary cookies are taken and kept in the browser (for security, it is not saved anywhere). Through cookies, a list of unfollowers is created and you can unfollow what you want.
If you want, you can create new interfaces yourself.
